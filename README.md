### 🏥 Hospital Management System – Web Application

The **Hospital Management System** is a web-based application built using **Java (Servlet & JSP)** that helps hospitals manage appointments, doctors, and patient information in a structured and efficient way. The system is divided into three main modules: **Admin, Doctor, and User (Patient)**, each with specific roles and responsibilities.

#### 🛠️ **Admin Module**:

* ➕ **Add and manage doctor profiles** with details like specialization, availability, and contact information.

* 📅 **Access and manage appointment records** for the entire hospital.
* 🩺 Acts as the central control to ensure smooth coordination between patients and doctors.

#### 👨‍⚕️ **Doctor Module**:

* 📋 **View scheduled appointments** assigned to them.

* 🔄 Helps doctors stay updated with their daily consultation schedule.

#### 👨‍💻 **User (Patient) Module**:

This system simplifies hospital workflows, reduces paperwork, and improves communication between patients, doctors, and administrators — ensuring better and faster healthcare service delivery.
